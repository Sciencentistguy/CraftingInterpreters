# CraftingInterpreters ðŸ“–

My code following the "Crafting Interpreters" [book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The book is in 2 sections:

## jlox

The first section is a tree-walk interpreter, called `jlox`, and is written in Java.

I used C++ instead of Java, because Java is a bad language.

My implementation of this is in `/cpplox`

## clox

The second section is a bytecode-based VM interpreter, called `clox`

### C++

I used C++ again, instead of C.

This is in `/clox-pp`.

This is incomplete, and will probably never be finished.

### Rust

I used Rust instead of C.

This is in `/rclox`

This is WIP.
